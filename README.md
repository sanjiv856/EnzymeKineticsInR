# Enzyme Kinetics In R

Enzyme Kinetics in R for fitting Michaelis-Menten models.

## Description

This project involves analyzing enzyme kinetics data using R, focusing on fitting Michaelis-Menten models. The figures are rendered using ggplot, and the data files in the "data" folder are used to run the script. Examine the data files and adjust your data accordingly to use the R script. 

## Figures

The figures generated by the script are saved in the "Figures" folder.

## Dependencies

- tidyverse
- grid
- gridExtra
- propagate
- broom

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
3. Run the R script.
4. View the generated figures in the "Figures" folder.

## Usage

The R script can be used to analyze enzyme kinetics data by fitting Michaelis-Menten models. Modify the script as needed and run it to analyze your own data.

## Data

The data files required for running the script are provided in the "data" folder.
